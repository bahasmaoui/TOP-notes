These are notes about using FlexBox

display: flex; (is like saying I want to use flex to align these items)

justify-content: horizental
align-items: vertical

flex-wrap: wrap/no-wrap/wrap-reverse (rjou3 lstar)

flex-direction: row, column, [reverse]

align/justify  -self (one thing only)

align-content(when there are multiple lines snn align-items)
